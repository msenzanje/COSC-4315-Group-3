        "answer": "The domain of the function is all real numbers except for negative values of x because the square root cannot be calculated for negative values. The inverse of this function would be a function that takes a value from the image and returns the input of the original function. To find the inverse, we need to switch the roles of the independent and dependent variables. So, the inverse of ( y = 3 - sqrt{x} ) is ( x = 3 - sqrt{y}). The domain of this new function is all real numbers except for negative values of y because the square root cannot be calculated for negative values. "

        "answer": "(a) To find the equation of the vertical asymptote x=a, we need to find the value of a such that when x approaches a from either side, the function becomes infinite or undefined. We can start by looking at the denominator of the function, which is (x^2 - 7x + 10). Factoring this expression, we get ((x - 5)(x - 2) = 0). This means that x=2 and x=5 are both possible vertical asymptotes. We can test each of these values to determine which one corresponds to the vertical asymptote. When x is close to 2 from either side, the function becomes (f(x) = frac{x^2 + 2}{x^2 - 7x + 10} = frac{x^2 + 2}{(x - 5)(x - 2)}). As x approaches 2 from either side, the function becomes infinite or undefined because the denominator is zero. Therefore, the equation of the vertical asymptote is (x = 2). (b) Using the graph of function f(x), we can answer the following questions: 1. (lim_{xto 2^-} f(x) =) 2. (lim_{x to 2^+} f(x) = ) 3. ( lim_{x to 2} f(x) = ) 4. (f(2) = )n5. ( lim_{x to 4} f(x) = ) 6. ( f(4) = ) From the graph, we can observe that as x approaches 2 from either side, the function becomes infinite or undefined because of the vertical asymptote at x=2. Therefore, the limits in parts (i) and (ii) are DNE. In part (iii), the function is continuous at x=2 because there is no discontinuity or vertical asymptote at that point. In parts (iv) through (vi), we can observe that the function has a horizontal tangent at x=4, which means that the limit as x approaches 4 from either side exists and is equal to the value of the function at that point. Therefore, ( lim_{x to 2} f(x) = f(4)). Since we have already determined that the function is continuous at x=2 and that (f(2) = frac{8}{3}), we can conclude that ( lim_{x to 2} f(x) = frac{8}{3}) and (f(4) = frac{8}{3}).Overall, the equation of the vertical asymptote is x=2, and the function has a horizontal tangent at x=4 with value (frac{8}{3})."

        "answer": "(a) The expression x = log2(8) + log2(1/8) + ln(e) can be simplified by combining the terms involving logarithms. We have: log2(8) + log2(1/8) = log2(8 * 1/8) = log2(1) = 0. Since log(e) is a natural logarithm, we can simplify it by writing e as its exponential form: ln(e) = ln(2.71828...) = 1. Thus the expression becomes 0 + 1 = 1. The answer for part (a) is 1. (b) To evaluate the limit of the given function as x approaches infinity, we can first notice that the numerator and denominator both have a degree of 2. Therefore, we can factor the numerator and rewrite the expression:[lim_{x to infty} frac{3x^2 - 5x + 2}{4 - 3x - x^2} = lim_{x to infty} frac{(3x - 1)(x-1)}{(2x-2)(x+1)}]. Now, as x approaches infinity, the term (x-1) becomes negligible compared to (x+1), since x will be much larger than 1. Thus, we can ignore the term (x-1) in the numerator and denominator when evaluating the limit:[lim_{x to infty} frac{3x^2 - 5x + 2}{4 - 3x - x^2} = lim_{x to infty} frac{(3x-1)(x+1)}{(2x-2)(x+1)}]. Since both (3x-1) and (x+1) are present in the numerator and denominator, we can cancel out (x+1), leaving us with:[lim_{x to infty} frac{3x^2 - 5x + 2}{4 - 3x - x^2} = lim_{x to infty} frac{(3x-1)}{(2x-2)}]. Now, as x approaches infinity, the term (3x-1) becomes negligible compared to (2x-2), since x will be much larger than 1. Thus, we can ignore the term (3x-1) when evaluating the limit:[lim_{x to infty} frac{3x^2 - 5x + 2}{4 - 3x - x^2} = frac{0}{0}]. Since this is an indeterminate form, we need to find the limit of both (3x-1)/(2x-2) and (x+1)/(x+1). Both limits are equal to 1. Thus, the answer for part (b) is 1."

        "answer": "Question 8, Part (a): To find the value of constant c so that the function G is continuous everywhere, we need to ensure that the function is continuous at x = 0. At x = 0, the two pieces of the function are defined as:[G(0) = 4 - cos 0 = 4] and [G(0) = sqrt{3c}]. Since we want G to be continuous at x = 0, we need both pieces of the function to be equal at this point. Therefore, we have:[4 = sqrt{3c}]. Squaring both sides, we get:[16 = 3c]. Dividing both sides by 3, we obtain:[c = frac{16}{3}]. Therefore, the value of constant c that makes the function G continuous everywhere is:[c = frac{16}{3}]. Question 8, Part (b): To find the horizontal and vertical asymptotes of the function f(x) = 2e^x/(e^x - 5), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as x approaches infinity or negative infinity. As x approaches negative infinity, the exponential term e^x approaches zero, so the function becomes:[f(x) rightarrow frac{2}{-5} = -frac{2}{5}]. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote as x approaches negative infinity is:[y = -frac{2}{5}]. As x approaches positive infinity, the exponential term e^x also approaches zero, but this time the function becomes:[f(x) rightarrow 0]. Therefore, there are no vertical asymptotes for the function f(x).So, the horizontal asymptote as x approaches positive infinity is:[y = 0] In conclusion, the horizontal asymptote as x approaches negative infinity is y = -frac{2}{5}, and there are no vertical asymptotes for the function f(x).

        "answer": "content=\"\\nOf course! Here's my work for question 6:\\n\\n(a) To find the equation of the plane determined by the points $(1, -1, 2)$, $(3, 0, 0)$, and $(4, 2, 1)$, we can use the formula:\\n\\n$$\\\\begin{aligned}\\nax + by + cz &= d \\\\\\\\\\n(a, b, c) &= (1, -1, 2), (3, 0, 0), (4, 2, 1)\\n\\\\end{aligned}$$\\n\\nSolving for $d$, we get:\\n\\n$$d = 2x + 3y - 4z$$\\n\\nTherefore, the equation of the plane is:\\n\\n$$2x + 3y - 4z = 0$$\\n\\n(b) To determine if the plane $x + y - z = 5$ is parallel to the plane we found in part (a), we can use the definition of a parallel line. A line is parallel to another line if and only if their slopes are equal.\\n\\nThe slope of the line $x + y - z = 5$ is $m = 1$. The slope of the plane we found in part (a) is also $m = 1$, so they are parallel.
