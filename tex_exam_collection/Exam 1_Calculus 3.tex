First Test
NAME:
You will have one hour and fifteen minutes to complete this exam. YOU MUST SHOW
ALL YOUR WORK FOR FULL CREDIT.. The majority of the credit you receive
will be based on the completeness and the clarity of your responses. Unless Stated other-
wise, answers should be exact values rather than approximations. Scientific calculators are
allowed, along with standard graphing calculators (i.e., TI-84), but not calculators that can
do symbolic differentiation/integration (e.g., IT-89, TI-Nspire). No other electronic device
is permitted. This test is closed book and closed notes.
